# kingdom-conquest-2-sega
PHP bot to play Kingdom Conquest 2 by SEGA. Designed to play thousands of bots via direct connection or by proxy. KC2 has been shut down by SEGA, so this code is just for reference.

The code is written for PHP 7.2. It only uses one library, httpful, for HTTP interactions.
The code uses a MySQL server to save the details of all the bots and progression. I have lost the schematics for these, sorry.

The code was used to control over 2000 bots on SEGA servers and includes many exploits that I found while coding it. The greatest of these was the ability to log on to ANY user account due to bad coding by SEGA in the authentication process.
